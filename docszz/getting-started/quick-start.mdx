# Quick Start Guide

Getting started with your documentation is simple! Just follow this step:

## Create Your MDX File and Add Metadata

Inside your project, navigate to the `docs` folder and create a new `.mdx` file:

```sh
project-root/docs/YOUR-PAGE-NAME.mdx
```

At the top of your MDX file, add the following metadata:

```ts
---
title: HTTP Server
description: This section is about HTTP Server.
---
```

<div>
  - **`title`**: Defines the title displayed on the page.
  <br />- **`description`**: Helps with SEO and improves discoverability.
</div>

<Note>
  Use hyphens (`-`) in file names instead of spaces or special characters. The
  breadcrumb navigation will automatically format hyphens as spaces.
</Note>

## Start Writing

Below the metadata, start writing your documentation using Markdown and MDX. You can include:

- Regular Markdown content
- Code blocks
- React components (if needed)

Once your file is created, it will automatically be available in the route and search bar.

<FolderTree className="overflow-hidden p-2">
  <Folder element="project-root" defaultOpen={true}>
    <Folder element="docs" defaultOpen={true}>
      <File>
        <p>your-page-name.mdx</p>
      </File>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</FolderTree>

## Optional: Add to Sidebar and Table of Contents

If you want your new page to appear in the sidebar and TOC:

- Visit **[docs/customization/sidebar](/docs/customization/sidebar)** to customization the sidebar.
- Visit **[docs/customization/toc](/docs/customization/toc)** to configure the table of contents.
