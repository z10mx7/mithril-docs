# No-Setup Search Bar 🚀

One of the coolest things about **Pinexio** is its built-in search functionality. Thanks to **Contentlayer**, there is absolutely **no additional setup** required. Any `.mdx` file inside the `docs/` folder is automatically indexed and searchable. That means **no third-party libraries**, no extra indexing steps, and no configuration—just write your documentation, and it’s instantly searchable!

## 🔍 How It Works

The logic for searching and highlighting results is handled inside the **`SearchDialog`** component. Here’s how it works:

1. **Regex-based search**: The search input filters through all `.mdx` files and highlights matching text.
2. **Instant results**: Matches appear as you type, making navigation seamless.
3. **Keyboard shortcut support**: Press `Cmd + K` (Mac) or `Ctrl + K` (Windows/Linux) to open the search box instantly.
4. **Highlighted snippets**: The searched term is highlighted within the results.

## ✨ Key Features

- **📂 No Configuration Needed** – Contentlayer automatically makes all `.mdx` files searchable.
- **⚡ Instant Search** – Type in the search box, and relevant results appear immediately.
- **🎨 Customizable Highlighting** – The `highlightText` function ensures matched keywords stand out.
- **⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts** – Quick access using `Cmd + K` or `Ctrl + K`.
- **📌 Contextual Snippets** – The `getSnippet` function provides relevant text around the search term.

## 🛠 Customization

Developers can tweak the search experience by modifying:

- `highlightText(text, searchTerm)`: Controls how search terms are highlighted.
- `getSnippet(text, searchTerm, contextLength)`: Adjusts how much surrounding text is shown in results.
- Styling: The UI is fully customizable with Tailwind CSS.

## 🔧 Code Snippet: Search Highlighting

```tsx
function highlightText(text: string, searchTerm: string): React.ReactNode {
  if (!searchTerm) return text;
  const regex = new RegExp(`(${searchTerm})`, 'gi');
  const parts = text.split(regex);
  return (
    <>
      {parts.map((part, i) =>
        regex.test(part) ? (
          <span key={i} className="bg-yellow-300 dark:text-black rounded-sm">
            {part}
          </span>
        ) : (
          part
        )
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```
