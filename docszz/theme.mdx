# Theming in Your Project

## Overview

The theming system in your project is defined in `src/global.css`. It includes both **light** and **dark** themes, ensuring consistency throughout the application. Any changes to themes should be made in this file to maintain a unified styling approach.

## Understanding Foreground and Background

- **Background**: Represents the underlying surface color of an element, such as page backgrounds, cards, and modals.
- **Foreground**: Refers to everything that appears in front of the background, such as text, icons, and interactive elements.
- Maintaining a proper contrast between foreground and background ensures readability and accessibility.

## Primary and Secondary Colors

- **Primary Color**: The main color used in the UI, typically for branding, buttons, and highlights.
- **Secondary Color**: A complementary color used for less prominent elements, such as secondary buttons and backgrounds.

These colors are defined using **HSL variables**, making it easier to adjust them globally without modifying individual components.

## Where to Modify Themes

To update themes, modify the variables in `@layer base` inside `global.css`. Below is a highlighted snippet showing where developers should make changes:

```css
:root {
  /* Light Mode */
  --background: 0 0% 100%; /* White */
  --foreground: 0 0% 9%; /* Black */

  --primary: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;
  --primary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;

  --secondary: 210 40% 96.1%;
  --secondary-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;
}

.dark {
  /* Dark Mode */
  --background: 0 0% 4%; /* Very dark */
  --foreground: 0 0% 93%; /* Light text */

  --primary: 210 40% 98%;
  --primary-foreground: 222.2 47.4% 11.2%;

  --secondary: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;
  --secondary-foreground: 210 40% 98%;
}
```

## Additional Theme Variables

Other UI components also use variables to define styling, including:

- **Borders** (`--border`, `--border-header`)
- **Status Colors** (`--success`, `--warning`, `--destructive`)
- **Components** (`--card`, `--popover`, `--button`)
- **Sidebar** (`--sidebar`, `--sidebar-active`)

Developers can customize these variables based on design requirements.

## Summary

- **Make theme changes in `src/global.css`**.
- **Understand foreground (text, icons) vs. background (page, containers)**.
- **Modify primary and secondary colors for branding consistency**.
- **Ensure contrast for accessibility**.
- **Leverage theme variables for easy customization**.
